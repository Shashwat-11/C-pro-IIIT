# C-pro-IIIT

This repository contains questions and resources from my Computer Programming (C-pro) course at IIIT, including both lab exercises and assignments.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific assignment or lab session. Inside each folder, you will find:

- **Write-ups**: Descriptions and explanations for each question (no solutions).
- **Handouts**: Original problem folder which contains test cases and the main files where the code is written.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate to an Assignment or Lab Folder**: Browse the folder that corresponds to the topic or assignment youâ€™re interested in.
2. **Read the Write-ups**: These provide context and explanations for each question without revealing the solutions.
3. **Review the Handouts**: Each handout contains the problem descriptions, test cases, and the main files for writing code.
4. **Run the Code**: The code is written directly in the main files within the handouts folder.

## Acknowledgments

This work is part of my coursework at IIIT, and the problems provided in the handouts are part of the Computer Programming course curriculum.
